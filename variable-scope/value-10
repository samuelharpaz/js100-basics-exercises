{
  firstName: 'Jane',
  lastName: 'Doe'
}

The myFunction function reassigns the value of the firstName property of the global object a, which is possible even though a is a const variable, because there's no problem reassigning an object property as long as you don't reassign the entire a variable to a different value.

The final console.log then logs the transformed a object to the console.
